Identifying Customer Segments was the 2nd project of my Supervised and Unsupervised Learning (The 4th class of my NANODEGREE).

This project required the cleaning of geographical data, scaling, applying a PCA, and finally applying the KMeans to cluster all the features available. Once the geographical data was fit 
and transformed, I then applied the transformation of the Customer database to find, in general, who shops at the Mail-Order company.
